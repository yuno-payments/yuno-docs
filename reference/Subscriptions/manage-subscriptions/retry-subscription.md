- Only the **most recent payment** of the subscription can be retried.
- Multiple manual retries can be executed **only if** the previous retry attempt resulted in a DECLINED status.
- Manually triggering a retry **stops** the [smart retry scheme](doc:retries) for the corresponding payment. The following payments of the subscription will follow the smart retry scheme if enabled in the creation. 
- After the successful retry attempt, the system **continues** with the next scheduled subscription charge.
- If neither condition is met, an **INVALID_REQUEST** error is returned.
