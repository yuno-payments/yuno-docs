A payment with a **PENDING** status due to an **AUTHORIZE** transaction status (due to card authorization) can be canceled before it is completed if the payment is no longer required. Sending a cancel request will update the payment's status to **CANCELLED**.

If you need a receipt for the canceled transaction, you can retrieve it after it has been created. To do this, use the [Retrieve Payment by ID](ref:retrieve-payment-by-id) endpoint and check the `receipt_url` field in the `payment.transaction` object.

To use this endpoint, you have to provide an `X-Idempotency-Key` in your request. Check the [Authentication](ref:authentication#idempotency) page for more information.
