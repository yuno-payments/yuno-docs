If you want to process payments in a Single Step (Authorization and Capture simultaneously), you need to send the `payment_method.detail.card.capture` attribute as `true`, so the payment is captured automatically.

To test all possible transaction outcomes within Yuno in **Sandbox**, please refer to the following [documentation](doc:yuno-testing-gateway#44-provide-the-payment-method-information) for **test data**.

On the other hand, if you wish to process the payment in Two Steps (First Authorization and then Capture), you need to send `payment_method.detail.card.capture` attribute as `false`. Please follow the steps below to implement a two-step flow:

1. Create an authorization using the [Authorize Payment](ref:authorize-payment) request.
2. Capture the created authorization using the [Capture Authorization](ref:capture-authorization) request.

Note that this request requires an `X-Idempotency-Key`. Check the [Authentication](ref:authentication#idempotency) page for more information.
