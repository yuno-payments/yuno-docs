title: Initiate Recovery Outreach for Abandoned User Flows
excerpt: >-
  This endpint allows merchants to notify Yuno's Recovery Agent when a user
  abandons their purchase flow, such as during product selection or after
  initiating checkout, before completing a payment. The submitted data enables
  Yuno to follow up with the user via call or WhatsApp to encourage completion
  of the transaction.

  > ## ðŸ“˜ Use Case Example

  > A user named Jane Doe adds a pair of wireless headphones to her cart on a
  merchant's website but abandons the checkout process. The merchant's system
  detects this and sends the relevant payload to Yunoâ€™s Recovery Agent API. Yuno
  then initiates a WhatsApp message to Jane, reminding her of the items left in
  her cart and offering assistance to complete the purchase.
