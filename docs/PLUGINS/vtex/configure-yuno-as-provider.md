8. After you select the payment method, a new dialog is displayed where you need to configure the payment provider:
   1. At the **Process with provider**, select **Yuno**.
   2. Add special conditions if necessary. For additional information regarding configuring the special conditions, access [Configuring payment special conditions](https://help.vtex.com/tutorial/special-conditions--tutorials_456#). For further information on configuring payment conditions considering installments with or without interest, check the [VTEX page](https://help.vtex.com/en/tutorial/how-to-configure-payment-conditions--tutorials_455?\&utm_source=autocomplete#installments-without-interest).
   3. Click **Save**.
   4. Change the **Status**  to **Active**.

> ðŸ“˜ Adding Multiple Payment Methods
>
> If you want to add more than one payment method to offer to your clients, Visa and Mastercard for example, you need to repeat steps **7** and **8** two times, one for Visa and the other for Mastercard.


9. As the last step, you have to configure the Webhook URL to receive the updates from the payments. 
   1. Access the [Yuno Dashboard](https://auth.y.uno/u/login?) and select **Developers**. 
   2. Select the **Webhooks** tab.
   3. Click **add webhook**. The webhook  form will show up, where you should provide the following information:
      1. **Name**: Define a name for the VTEX webhook.
      2. **Endpoint URL**: You should inform the following URL **https\://store\_name/\_v/yunopartnerbr.yuno/v4/webhook**.
      3. **x-api-key** and **x-secret**: You can set any information here. For example, you can add **VTEX** for both fields. 
   4. For **Trigger on**, check all events that should notify you through the webhooks. Yuno recommends checking all options.
   5. Click **Add**.

![](https://files.readme.io/ccc5357-image.png)After completing the steps above, your clients can access a new payment method at checkout. If you configure Visa, for example, when your customers arrive at the checkout phase and select credit card as the payment method, the Yuno checkout will gather all the information required for fraud screening and 3DS services in the background while using the VTEX credit card form.

Once you start receiving payments in VTEX with Yuno, you will be able to see all the information related to the transactions in your [Yuno dashboard](doc:payments-2) as a regular payment. 

* As additional info in the payment detail, particularly inside the metadata struct, you will also be able to identify the VTEX account related to the payment creation.

  ```json
  "metadata": [
      {
        "key": "vtex_account",
        "value": "[your_vtex_subaccount]"
      }
    ]
  ```
