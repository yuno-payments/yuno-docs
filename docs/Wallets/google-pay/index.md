Google Pay™, a cutting-edge digital wallet and online payment system, revolutionizes how users make payments by securely storing credit card information. Unlike conventional payment methods, Google Pay ensures enhanced security and privacy throughout the payment process.

When utilizing Google Pay™, your confidential credit or debit card details are never directly shared with the merchant. Instead, a unique token is generated, serving as a representation of your payment information. This token is utilized to process the payment, provide an extra layer of protection, and prevent unauthorized access to your data.

Considering the distinct mechanism of Google Pay™, it is essential to grasp its working principles before seamlessly integrating it with Yuno.
