A workflow is a series of sequential steps crafted to handle a specific use case. These workflows are customized to suit the unique needs of individual businesses, guaranteeing a smooth and efficient payment processing journey.

You can use the Yuno payment solutions through two types of workflows:

* **Checkout**: Yuno Checkout is an integration solution based on SDKs. 
* **Direct**: The Direct is a back-to-back integration solution based entirely on API endpoints usage. 

In addition to those two workflows, Yuno also provides integration through e-commerce plugins.

## Checkout

With the Checkout workflow, the Yuno integration into your system will require less code. In addition, Checkout workflow integration options eliminate or reduce your PCI responsibility. You can choose between the three variations available. 

## Direct

This back-to-back integration approach gives users complete control over the checkout process and allows for a server-to-server connection. Thus, you can build your customized user interface to give your customers a unique and tailored experience. By leveraging Yuno's APIs and server-to-server connection, the Direct workflow is accessible on any platform capable of performing API requests. While this integration method offers great flexibility, it also has higher PCI compliance responsibilities. 

## Plugins

Yuno plugins offer e-commerce platforms a convenient and secure option for processing payments. By integrating a Yuno plugin into these platforms, merchants can enjoy seamless payment integration with any code requirements and processing with security measures.
