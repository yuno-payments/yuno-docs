On this page, you will find all the steps to add, configure, and use the Lite iOS SDK to enroll payment methods in your iOS project.

## Step 1: Include the library in your project

You can add the library using CocoaPods or Swift Package Manager.

### CocoaPods

To add the Yuno SDK to your iOS project, you need to install the Yuno SDK. If you do not have a Podfile, follow the [CocoaPods guide](https://guides.cocoapods.org/using/using-cocoapods.html) to create one. After creating the Podfile, you will integrate the Yuno SDK with Cocoapods by adding the line below to your Podfile.

```ruby
pod 'YunoSDK', '~> 1.1.22'
```

After, you need to run the installation:

```ruby
pod install

```

### Swift Package Manager

To add the Yuno SDK to your iOS project, you need to install the [Swift Package Manager](https://www.swift.org/package-manager/). With the Swift package set up, add Yuno SDK as a dependency, as presented in the following code block:

```swift
dependencies: [
    .package(url: "https://github.com/yuno-payments/yuno-sdk-ios.git", .upToNextMajor(from: "1.1.17"))
]
```

## Step 2: Enroll a new payment method

Yuno's iOS SDK provides an enrollment feature for payment methods integrated into Yuno. To display a view controller with the flow for integrating a new payment method, call the method presented in the following code snippet:

```swift
protocol YunoPaymentDelegate: AnyObject {

    var customerSession: String { get }
  	// The complete list of country codes is available on https://docs.y.uno/docs/country-coverage-yuno-sdk
    var countryCode: String { get }
    var language: String? { get }
    var viewController: UIViewController? { get }

    func yunoEnrollmentResult(_ result: Yuno.Result)
}

class ViewController: YunoEnrollmentDelegate {

    func startEnrollment() {
        Yuno.enrollPayment(with: self, showPaymentStatus: Bool)
    }
}

```

The following table presents all the protocol requirements you have to provide and their descriptions.

| Parameter                                      | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| :--------------------------------------------- | :------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `customerSession`                              | Refers to the current payment's customer session.                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| `countryCode`                                  | This parameter determines the country for which the payment process is being configured. The complete list of supported countries and their country code is available on the [Country coverage](doc:country-coverage-yuno-sdk)  page. |
| `language`                                     | Defines the language to be used in the payment forms. You can set it to one of the available language options: es (Spanish), en (English), or pt (Portuguese).                                                                        |
| `yunoEnrollmentResult(\_ result: Yuno.Result)` | This method is called when the enrollment process is completed, providing the result of the enrollment as a parameter of type `Yuno.Result`.                                                                                          |

The parameter`showPaymentStatus`is used to determine whether the payment status should be displayed. Passing `true`as an argument will show the payment status while passing `false` indicates that the payment status should not be displayed.

The class `ViewController ` is a subclass of `UIViewController `and conforms to the `YunoEnrollmentDelegate `protocol. It includes a function called` enrollPayment(with delegate: YunoEnrollmentDelegate, showPaymentStatus: Bool)`, which parameters are described below: 

- `delegate: YunoEnrollmentDelegate` : The delegate object that handles enrollment callbacks.
- `showPaymentStatus: Bool`: A Boolean flag that determines whether to display status views during the payment enrollment process.

The method `enrollPayment` initiates the payment enrollment process. You should call It in response to user interactions, such as pressing a button. The method utilizes the provided `delegate `to manage enrollment events and, based on the parameter `showPaymentStatus `decides whether to show visual feedback about the enrollment status.

## Step 3: Enrollment status

[block:html]
{
  "html": "<style> \n  .noMargin {\n    margin: 0 !important;\n  }\n  </style>\n\n<body>\n  <div class=\"infoBlockContainer alert\">\n    <div class=\"verticalLineAlert\"></div>\n    <div>\n      <div class=\"contentContainer\">\n        <h3  class=\"noMargin\">This feature is for payment methods executing deep links</h3>\n        <p>\n          This feature is only used if you enroll in a payment method that executes deep links. If you are not enrolling in a payment method that executes deep links, you can ignore Step 3.\n        </p>\n      </div>\n    </div>\n  </div>\n</body>"
}
[/block]


If you use a payment method that requires a deep link to return to your app, use the method described in the following code block to obtain the enrollment status in your AppDelegate. The `url.scheme` should be the same as the `callback_url` used when creating the `customer_session`.

```swift
func application(_ app: UIApplication, open url: URL, options: [UIApplication.OpenURLOptionsKey : Any] = [:]) -> Bool {
  
  // Here your scheme URL should be the same as the callback_url you set in the customer session
  
  guard url.scheme == "yunoexample" else { return false }
  return Yuno.receiveDeeplink(url, showStatusView: true)
}

```

## Complementary Features

Yuno iOS SDK provides additional services and configurations you can use to improve customers' experience. 

### Render option

When presenting the enrollment, you can also choose one of the render options for the card form. You have the following options:

- `ONE_STEP` 
- `STEP_BY_STEP`

To change the render option, set the `cardFormType` equal one of the available options. Each option is presented below.
