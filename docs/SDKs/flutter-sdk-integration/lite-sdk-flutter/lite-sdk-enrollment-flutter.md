## Step 1: Add the SDK Dependency

To add the Yuno SDK to your Flutter project, run the following command:

```dart Dart
dart pub add yuno
```

## Step 2: Initialize the SDK with the Public Key

Create an instance of `Yuno.init` by providing a valid `PUBLIC_API_KEY`. Refer to the [Yuno documentation](https://docs.y.uno/) for details on obtaining [API credentials](https://docs.y.uno/docs/developers-credentials).

```dart Dart
await Yuno.init(
  apiKey: 'your_api_key_here',
  country_code: 'your_country_code', // The complete list of country codes is available at: 
                                    // https://docs.y.uno/docs/country-coverage-yuno-sdk
  yunoConfig: YunoConfig(
    lang: YunoLanguage.en, // Supported languages: ENGLISH, SPANISH, PORTUGUESE, MALAY, INDONESIAN, THAI
    cardflow: CardFlow.multiStep, // Default card flow
    saveCardEnable: true, // Default: true
    keepLoader: true, // Default: true
  ),
  iosConfig: IosConfig(), // Optional, can use default value
);

```

Below is a table describing the parameters required for initializing the Yuno SDK in your Flutter application. These settings allow you to customize the SDK behavior to align with your application needs:

[block:parameters]
{
  "data": {
    "h-0": "Parameter",
    "h-1": "Description",
    "0-0": "`apiKey`",
    "0-1": "Your unique public API key for authentication.",
    "1-0": "`country_code`",
    "1-1": "The userâ€™s country code. Refer to the [Country Coverage](https://docs.y.uno/docs/country-coverage-yuno-sdk) page for a complete list of supported country codes.",
    "2-0": "`yunoConfig`",
    "2-1": "Configures various SDK settings. Contains additional parameters listed below.",
    "3-0": "`lang`",
    "3-1": "The language for SDK content. Supported options include: <br> `en` - English <br> `es` - Spanish <br> `pt` - Portuguese <br> `ms` - Malay <br> `id` - Indonesian <br> `th` - Thai",
    "4-0": "`cardflow`",
    "4-1": "Defines the card flow type for the payment process. The default is `CardFlow.multiStep`.",
    "5-0": "`saveCardEnable`",
    "5-1": "Specifies whether to enable the \"Save Card\" option. Defaults to `true`.",
    "6-0": "`keepLoader`",
    "6-1": "Controls whether to keep the loader visible. Defaults to `true`.",
    "7-0": "`iosConfig`",
    "7-1": "Optional iOS-specific configurations. If omitted, the default configuration is used."
  },
  "cols": 2,
  "rows": 8,
  "align": [
    null,
    null
  ]
}
[/block]


## Step 3: Add the SDK Widget Handler

Integrate `YunoEnrollmentListener` to track and manage enrollment state changes in your application.

```dart Dart
YunoEnrollmentListener(
  listener: (state) {
    // Handle [state] it is YunoEnrollmentState
    // - [enrollmentStatus]:  [reject,succeded,fail,processing,internalError,cancelByUser]
  },
  child: SomeWidget(),
)

```

## Step 4: Enroll a New Payment Method

To enroll a new payment method, use the `enrollmentPayment` method:

```dart
await Yuno.enrollmentPayment(
  arguments: EnrollmentArguments(
    customerSession: 'YOUR_CUSTOMER_SESSION',
    showPaymentStatus: true, // Optional by default is true,
    country_code: 'your_country_code', // Optional by default the value setted in the initialize,
  ),
);

```

The following table presents all the protocol requirements you have to provide and their descriptions.

| Parameter           | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| ------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `customerSession`   | Refers to the current payment's customer session.                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| `country_code`      | Determines the country for the payment process. The complete list of supported countries is available on the [Country coverage](https://docs.y.uno/docs/country-coverage-yuno-sdk) page. By default, it uses the same value you set during initialization. |
| `showPaymentStatus` | A Boolean flag that determines whether to display status views during the payment enrollment process. Defaults to `true`.                                                                                                                                  |

## Step 5: Enrollment Status

The possible enrollment states are listed below:  

| Status          | Description                                                                                                    |
| --------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `succeeded`     | The enrollment was completed successfully.                                                                     |
| `fail`          | The enrollment process failed due to an error during the payment process, preventing completion.               |
| `processing`    | The enrollment is in progress, possibly awaiting approval from a third-party service or financial institution. |
| `reject`        | The enrollment was rejected, possibly due to insufficient funds, suspected fraud, or policy violations.        |
| `internalError` | An unexpected system error occurred during the enrollment process.                                             |
| `cancelByUser`  | The user voluntarily canceled the enrollment before completion.                                                |

### Complementary Features

The **Yuno Flutter SDK** offers additional features to enhance the customer experience. You can check the current enrollment configurations and use [SDK Customizations](https://docs.y.uno/docs/sdk-customization) to modify the appearance, match your brand, or adjust the loader settings.
