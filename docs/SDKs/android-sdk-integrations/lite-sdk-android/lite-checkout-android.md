The Yuno Lite SDK for Android provides a pre-built UI solution focused on card payment processing. This SDK offers a streamlined integration process with essential payment functionality, making it ideal for merchants who:

* Need a quick implementation with minimal customization requirements
* Want to focus primarily on card payment processing
* Prefer a ready-to-use UI that handles the payment flow

The Lite SDK includes core features like:

* Pre-built payment UI components
* Card payment processing
* Basic payment status handling
* Essential error management

For merchants requiring more advanced features like multiple payment methods, custom UI, or advanced fraud prevention, consider using our [Full SDK](doc:full-sdk-android) instead.

## Requirements

Before starting the Yuno Android SDK integration, make sure your project meets the [technical requirements](doc:requirements-android). In addition, ensure the following prerequisites are in place:

* You must have an active Yuno account.
* To perform the integration, you'll need your Yuno API credentials (`account_id`, `public-api-key`, and `private-secret-key`), which you can obtain from the [Developers credentials section](https://docs.y.uno/docs/developers-credentials) of the Yuno dashboard. These credentials are required to authenticate requests to the Yuno API. The API is used to:
  * Create a `customer`, which is required before initiating payments
  * Create a `checkout_session`, which initializes the payment flow
  * Create the payment associated with the session

> ðŸ“˜ SDK Version
>
> Access the [Release notes](#docs/release-notes-android-sdk) or the [Yuno Android SDK repository](https://github.com/yuno-payments/yuno-sdk-android) to verify the last SDK version available.

## Step 1: Create a customer

Before initiating payments, you need to create a customer using the [Create customer endpoint](ref:create-customer). This step is required to:

* Identify the person making the payment
* Enable saved card functionality (if enabled)
* Track payment history

The customer ID returned from this endpoint will be used when creating the `checkout_session`.

## Step 2: Create a checkout session

To initialize the payment flow, create a new `checkout_session` using the [Create checkout session](ref:create-checkout-session) endpoint. Make sure to:

* Include the customer ID obtained from the previous step
* Store the returned `checkout_session` ID for use in Step 5 of the integration
* The `checkout_session` is unique for each payment attempt and cannot be reused

> ðŸš§ External Browser Return Handling
>
> If your payment flow sends users to an external browser (for example, for 3DS authentication or bank redirects), make sure to set the `callback_url` when creating your checkout session. For a step-by-step guide on handling the return to your app, see [Handle external browser return (callback\_url)](/docs/external-browser-callback-android).

## Step 3: Include the library in your project

Ensure the Yuno SDK file is included in your project through Gradle. Then, add the repository source using the following code line:

```kotlin
maven { url "https://yunopayments.jfrog.io/artifactory/snapshots-libs-release" }
```

After, include the code below in the file `build.gradle` to add the Yuno SDK dependency to the application.

```kotlin
dependencies {
    implementation 'com.yuno.payments:android-sdk:{last_version}'
}
```

### Permissions

Yuno SDK includes, by default, the `INTERNET` permission, which is required to make network requests.

```xml
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.INTERNET" />
```

## Step 4: Initialize SDK with the public key

To initialize the SDK:

1. Get your public API keys from the [Yuno dashboard](https://dashboard.y.uno/)
2. Create a custom application class if you don't have one
3. Initialize the SDK by calling `Yuno.initialize()` in your application's `onCreate()` method, passing your API key and configuration:

```kotlin
class CustomApplication : Application() {
  override fun onCreate() {
    super.onCreate()
    Yuno.initialize(
      this,
      "your api key",
      config: YunoConfig, // This is a data class to use custom configs in the SDK.
    )
  }
}
```

Use the data class `YunoConfig` to customize the SDK's behavior. You can include this configuration when calling `Yuno.initialize()`. The available options are:

```kotlin
data class YunoConfig(
    val cardFlow: CardFormType = CardFormType.ONE_STEP, // Optional: Defines the card form flow type. ONE_STEP shows a single screen for card details, TWO_STEP splits it across multiple screens.
    val saveCardEnabled: Boolean = false, // Determines whether to display the "Save card" checkbox on card flows.
    val keepLoader: Boolean = false, // If true, keeps the Yuno loading screen visible until payment creation and continuation. Requires an additional step described later.
    val cardFormDeployed: Boolean = false, // Full SDK only: If true, displays the card form within the payment methods list. If false, shows the card form on a separate screen.
    val language: YunoLanguage? = null, // Sets the SDK language. If null or not provided, defaults to the device language.
    val styles: YunoStyles? = null // Enables SDK-wide UI customization.
)
```

The following table includes descriptions for each customization available.

| Customization option | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| -------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **cardFlow**         | It is an optional configuration that defines Payment and Enrollment Card flow. By default, the `CardFormType.ONE_STEP` option is used. Check the section [Render options](#render-options) for more information.                                                            |
| **saveCardEnabled**  | Enables the **Save card checkbox** on card flows. Check the [Save card](#save-card-for-future-payments) section for more information.                                                                                                                                       |
| **keepLoader**       | Keep Yuno's loading screen until you create and continue with payment. To use this feature you need to use the function `startCompletePaymentFlow()`, described in the next sections. Check the [Loader](#loader) for additional information.                               |
| **language**         | Defines the language to be used in the payment forms. If you don't send or provide a null value, Yuno SDK will use the device language. You can set it to one of the available language options: `es` (Spanish), `en` (English), `pt` (Portuguese).                         |
| **styles**           | Enables SDK-wide UI customization. Use it to define global visual styles like font family and button appearance (color, padding, radius, typography) through a `YunoStyles` object. For more information, check the [`styles`](/docs/full-checkout-android#styles) section. |

> ðŸš§ Loading Screen Persistence
>
> To ensure that the Yuno loading screen persists until you create and proceed with the payment, you need to use the [startCompletePaymentFlow()](#docs/loader-android) function.

You also need to update your manifest to use your application:

```xml
<application android:name=".CustomApplication"></application>
```

## Step 5: Start the checkout process

To initiate a new payment process with the Lite SDK, call the `startCheckout` method in the `onCreate()` function of the activity that integrates the SDK:

```kotlin
startCheckout(
  checkoutSession: "checkout_session",
  // Replace with your target country's ISO code (e.g., "US" for USA, "FR" for France). The complete list of country_codes is available on https://docs.y.uno/docs/country-coverage-yuno-sdk.
  country_code: "US",
  callbackPaymentState: ((String?) -> Unit)?,
  merchantSessionId: String? = null //Optional - Default null 
)
```

Below is a description of the required parameters to start the checkout.

| Parameter              | Description                                                                                                                                                                               |
| :--------------------- | :---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `checkoutSession`      | A unique identifier for the checkout session associated with the payment. It is required to initialize the payment process and grants access to the customer's available payment methods. |
| `country_code`         | Country code where the payment is performed. See [Country coverage](doc:country-coverage-yuno-sdk) for a complete list of supported countries and their codes.                            |
| `callbackPaymentState` | It's a function that returns the current payment process. Sending this function is not mandatory if you do not need the result.                                                           |
| `merchantSessionId`    | An identifier used by the merchant to track the payment.                                                                                                                                  |

### Callback Payment State

The `callbackPaymentState` parameter is a function that returns the current payment process. Sending this function is not mandatory if you do not need the result. The possible states are:

```kotlin
const val PAYMENT_STATE_SUCCEEDED = "SUCCEEDED"
const val PAYMENT_STATE_FAIL = "FAIL"
const val PAYMENT_STATE_PROCESSING = "PROCESSING"
const val PAYMENT_STATE_REJECT = "REJECT"
const val PAYMENT_STATE_INTERNAL_ERROR = "INTERNAL_ERROR"
const val PAYMENT_STATE_STATE_CANCELED_BY_USER = "CANCELED"
```

The following table provide additional information about the possible states:

| **State**        | **Description**                                                                                                                 | **Additional action required**                                                                                |
| ---------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `SUCCEEDED`      | The transaction or payment process was successfully completed without any errors.                                               | No.                                                                                                           |
| `FAIL`           | The transaction failed due to errors such as data validation issues, server connection failures, or technical/network problems. | Yes. Investigate the cause of failure (validation, network, server) and take corrective measures.             |
| `PROCESSING`     | The transaction is currently in progress, awaiting approval or verification.                                                    | No.                                                                                                           |
| `REJECT`         | The transaction was rejected due to reasons like insufficient funds or suspected fraudulent activity.                           | Yes. Inform the user of the rejection, provide the reason if possible, and suggest actions.                   |
| `INTERNAL_ERROR` | An unexpected internal error occurred within the system handling the payment process.                                           | Yes. Requires technical intervention to review the system, fix internal issues, and retry or inform the user. |
| `CANCELED`       | The user voluntarily canceled the transaction or abandoned the payment process.                                                 | No.                                                                                                           |

## Step 6: Initiate the payment process

To start a payment process, you have to call the method `startPaymentLite`.

```kotlin
startPaymentLite(
    paymentSelected: PaymentSelected,
    callbackOTT:(String?) -> Unit, //Optional - Default null,
    callBackTokenWithInformation:(OneTimeTokenModel?) -> Unit, //Optional - Default null
    showPaymentStatus: Boolean, //Optional - Default true
) 
```

Below is a description of the required parameters to start the payment.

| Parameter                      | Description                                                                                                                                                            |
| :----------------------------- | :--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `paymentSelected`              | Inform the payment method selected by the buyer.                                                                                                                       |
| `showStatusYuno`               | A boolean that specifies whether the payment status should be displayed within the Yuno interface.                                                                     |
| `callbackOTT`                  | A required function that returns the updated one-time token needed to complete the payment process.                                                                    |
| `callBackTokenWithInformation` | A function that supplies detailed information about the one-time token, wrapped in a `OneTimeTokenModel` object, allowing for comprehensive handling of token details. |

You need to send an additional parameter, which is the vaulted token and/or the payment type that the user selected to make the payment.

```kotlin
PaymentSelected(
  vaultedToken : String "payment_vaulted_token",
  paymentMethodType : String "payment_type",
)
```

## Step 7: Get the OTT (one-time token)

The one-time token is a unique identifier that represents a payment session. This token is required to create a payment.

#### Callback one-time token

The one-time token callback returns the following parameters:

| Parameter    | Type   | Description                                      |
| ------------ | ------ | ------------------------------------------------ |
| oneTimeToken | String | one-time token generated for the payment session |

> ðŸš§ Loader Handling
>
> The merchant is responsible for handling the loader. Yuno offers an option to use our loader; however, the merchant can use their own loader and must make the corresponding configurations.

## Step 8: Create the payment

After completing the previous steps, create a payment by calling the [Create Payment endpoint](https://docs.y.uno/reference/create-payment) from your backend. This endpoint requires:

* The one-time token obtained in Step 7
* The `checkout_session` obtained in Step 2

> ðŸš§ Continue Payment Method Integration
>
> Yuno **requires** you integrate the `continuePayment` method of the SDK after the payment is created because certain asynchronous payment methods require additional action from the customer to complete it. The API will inform you of this scenario via the `sdk_action_required` field of the response, which will be returned as true. The `yuno.continuePayment()` function will display the additional screens to the customers, where they can carry out the necessary actions to complete the payment without needing you to handle every scenario.

For payment methods that require additional customer actions (such as 3DS authentication challenges) or asynchronous processing (like bank transfers), you'll need to integrate the SDK's `continuePayment` method after creating the payment. The Create Payment API response includes a `sdk_action_required` field that indicates whether this step is needed:

* If `TRUE`: Call `yuno.continuePayment()` to display additional screens for customer actions (e.g., 3DS authentication, bank redirect pages)
* If `FALSE`: Skip this step as no additional customer interaction is required

Here's how to implement the payment continuation flow:

```kotlin
continuePayment(
    showPaymentStatus: Boolean = true, // Optional â€“ Default true
    checkoutSession: String? = null,   // Optional â€“ Default null
    country_code: String? = null,       // Optional â€“ Default null
    callbackPaymentState: ((String?) -> Unit)? = null // Optional â€“ Default null
)
```

To show your payment status screens, you should send `FALSE` in the `showPaymentStatus` parameter. Then, get the payment state by callback.

## Render Mode (advanced integration)

For developers requiring advanced UI control, the Lite SDK also supports render mode integration. This mode provides fragment-based UI components that you can integrate into custom layouts, offering more flexibility while maintaining the streamlined Lite SDK functionality.

### Basic render mode setup

Use `startPaymentRender` for advanced UI integration:

```kotlin
fun Activity.startPaymentRender(
    checkoutSession: String? = null,
    countryCode: String? = null,
    coroutineScope: CoroutineScope,
    paymentSelected: PaymentSelected,
    listener: YunoPaymentRenderListener,
): YunoPaymentFragmentController
```

### Implementation example

```kotlin
class PaymentActivity : Activity() {
    
    private lateinit var fragmentController: YunoPaymentFragmentController
    
    private fun initializeRenderMode() {
        fragmentController = startPaymentRender(
            checkoutSession = checkoutSessionId,
            countryCode = "US",
            coroutineScope = lifecycleScope,
            paymentSelected = PaymentSelected.CARD,
            listener = object : YunoPaymentRenderListener {
                override fun showView(fragment: Fragment) {
                    // Display fragment in your custom layout
                    supportFragmentManager.beginTransaction()
                        .replace(R.id.payment_container, fragment)
                        .commit()
                }
                
                override fun returnOneTimeToken(oneTimeToken: String, additionalData: OneTimeTokenModel?) {
                    // Process token and continue payment
                    processPayment(oneTimeToken) {
                        fragmentController.continuePayment()
                    }
                }
                
                override fun returnStatus(resultCode: Int, paymentStatus: String) {
                    handlePaymentResult(paymentStatus)
                }
                
                override fun loadingListener(isLoading: Boolean) {
                    // Handle loading state
                    updateLoadingUI(isLoading)
                }
            }
        )
    }
}
```

### Key benefits

* **Custom UI Integration**: Embed payment components in your existing layouts
* **Fragment Compatibility**: Works with both XML and Jetpack Compose
* **Flow Control**: Manage form submission and payment continuation manually

> ðŸš§ Advanced Feature
>
> Render mode is designed for developers who need custom UI integration. For simpler implementations, use the standard Lite SDK methods described in the previous steps.

## Complementary features

Yuno Android SDK provides additional services and configurations you can use to improve customers' experience. Use the [SDK customization](doc:sdk-customizations-android) to change the SDK appearance to match your brand or to configure the loader.

### `styles`

With the `styles` customization option, you can define global visual styles like through a `YunoStyles` object. It lets you apply consistent branding across the SDK by customizing button appearance and typography.

```kotlin
data class YunoStyles(
    val buttonStyles: YunoButtonStyles? = null,
    val fontFamily: FontFamily? = null
)
```

| Parameter      | Description                                             |
| :------------- | :------------------------------------------------------ |
| `buttonStyles` | Customizes the primary buttons displayed in the SDK.    |
| `fontFamily`   | Sets the font family used across all SDK text elements. |

The `YunoButtonStyles` object lets you define specific settings for button appearance:

```kotlin
data class YunoButtonStyles(
    val backgroundColor: Color? = null,
    val contentColor: Color? = null,
    val cornerRadius: Dp? = null,
    val elevation: Dp? = null,
    val padding: Dp? = null,
    val fontFamily: FontFamily? = null,
    val fontSize: TextUnit? = null,
    val fontStyle: FontStyle? = null
)
```

To use the `styles` customization option, you have to use the `YunoConfig` data class, described in Step 2.

### Loader

The [Loader](https://docs.y.uno/docs/loader-android) enables you to control the use of the loader component.

### Save card for future payments

In addition, you can display a checkbox to save or enroll cards using `cardSaveEnable: true`. Below, you can find examples of the checkbox for both card form renders:

<Image align="center" src="https://files.readme.io/1c3d62f0307923298b22f18a1e58f86f8b6068a582315a0991ff8d802c475dbc-Card___save_for_future_payments.png" />

### Render options

You can choose between two card form render options. The following screenshots demonstrate the difference between `cardFormType` `ONE_STEP` and `STEP_BY_STEP`:
