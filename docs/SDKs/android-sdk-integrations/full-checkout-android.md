The Yuno Full SDK for Android provides a complete payment solution with a customizable UI. It offers advanced features like payment method management, fraud prevention, and seamless checkout flows, making it more feature-rich than our Headless SDK, which is specific to core payment processing capabilities.

## Requirements

Before starting the Yuno Android SDK, make sure your project meets the [technical requirements](doc:requirements-android). In addition, ensure the following prerequisites are in place:

* You must have an active Yuno account
* To perform the integration, you'll need your Yuno API credentials (`account_id`, `public-api-key`, and `private-secret-key`), which you can obtain from the [Developers section of the Yuno dashboard](https://docs.y.uno/docs/developers-credentials). These credentials are required to authenticate requests to the Yuno API. The API is used to:
  * Create a `checkout_session`, which initializes the payment flow
  * Create the payment associated with the session
* Before creating a payment, you must first create a customer using the [Create customer endpoint](ref:create-customer)

## Step 1: Include the library in your project

Ensure the Yuno SDK file is included in your project through Gradle. Then, add the repository source using the following code line:

```kotlin
maven { url "https://yunopayments.jfrog.io/artifactory/snapshots-libs-release" }
```

> ðŸ“˜ SDK Version
>
> Access the [Release notes](#docs/release-notes-android-sdk) or the [Yuno Android SDK repository](#https://github.com/yuno-payments/yuno-sdk-android) to verify the last SDK version available.

After, include the code below in the file `build.gradle` to add the Yuno SDK dependency to the application.

```kotlin
dependencies {
    implementation 'com.yuno.payments:android-sdk:{last_version}'
}
```

### Permissions

Yuno SDK includes, by default, the `INTERNET` permission, which is required to make network requests.

```xml
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.INTERNET" />
```

## Step 2: Initialize SDK with the public key

First, you must retrieve your public API keys from the [Yuno dashboard](https://dashboard.y.uno/).

If you haven't implemented a custom application, create one. In the `onCreate()` method of your application class, call the initialize function (`Yuno.initialize`) as shown in the example below:

```kotlin
class CustomApplication : Application() {
  override fun onCreate() {
    super.onCreate()
    Yuno.initialize(
      this,
      "<your-public-api-key>",
      config: YunoConfig, // This is a data class to use custom configs in the SDK.
    )
  }
}
```

Use the data class `YunoConfig` to customize the SDK's behavior. You can include this configuration when calling `Yuno.initialize()`. The available options are:

```kotlin
data class YunoConfig(
    val cardFlow: CardFormType = CardFormType.ONE_STEP, // Optional: Defines the card form flow type. ONE_STEP shows a single screen for card details, TWO_STEP splits it across multiple screens.
    val saveCardEnabled: Boolean = false, // Determines whether to display the "Save card" checkbox on card flows.
    val keepLoader: Boolean = false, // If true, keeps the Yuno loading screen visible until payment creation and continuation. Requires an additional step described later.
    val cardFormDeployed: Boolean = false, // Full SDK only: If true, displays the card form within the payment methods list. If false, shows the card form on a separate screen.
    val language: YunoLanguage? = null, // Sets the SDK language. If null or not provided, defaults to the device language.
    val styles: YunoStyles? = null // Enables SDK-wide UI customization.
)
```

The following table includes descriptions for each customization available.

<Table align={["left","left"]}>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>
        Customization option
      </th>

    </tr>
  </thead>

  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>
        **cardFlow**
      </td>

      <td>
        It is an optional configuration that defines Payment and Enrollment Card flow. By default, the `CardFormType.ONE_STEP` option is used. Check the section [Render options](/docs/full-checkout-android#render-options) for more information
      </td>
    </tr>

    <tr>

      </td>

      <td>
        Keep Yuno's loading screen until you create and continue with payment. To use this feature, you need to use the function `startCompletePaymentFlow()`, described in the next sections. Check the [Loader](#loader) for additional information.
      </td>
    </tr>

    <tr>
      <td>
        **cardFormDeployed**
      </td>

      <td>
        This option is only available for Full SDK. If `TRUE`, the system presents the card form deployed on the payment methods list. If `FALSE`, presents the normal card form on another screen.
      </td>
    </tr>

    <tr>
      <td>
        **language**
      </td>

      <td>
        Defines the language to be used in the payment forms. If you don't send or provide a null value, Yuno SDK will use the device language. You can set it to one of the available language options:

        * `es` (Spanish)
        * `en` (English)
        * `pt` (Portuguese)
      </td>
    </tr>

    <tr>
      <td>
        **styles**
      </td>

      <td>
        Enables SDK-wide UI customization. Use it to define global visual styles like font family and button appearance (color, padding, radius, typography) through a `YunoStyles` object. For more information, check the [`styles`](/docs/full-checkout-android#styles)  section.
      </td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</Table>

> ðŸš§ Loading Screen Persistence
>
> To ensure that the Yuno loading screen persists until you create and proceed with the payment, you need to use the [startCompletePaymentFlow()](#loader-android) function.

You also need to update your manifest to use your application:

```xml
<application android:name=".CustomApplication"></application>
```

## Step 3: Create the checkout session

Each payment requires a new `checkout_session`, which provides access to all available payment methods for a specific customer. To obtain a new `checkout_session`, use the [Create checkout session](ref:create-checkout-session) endpoint. This session is then used to initiate the payment.

> ðŸ“˜ External Browser Return Handling
>
> If your payment flow sends users to an external browser (for example, for 3DS authentication or bank redirects), make sure to set the `callback_url` when creating your checkout session. For a step-by-step guide on handling the return to your app, see [Handle external browser return (callback\_url)](/docs/external-browser-callback-android).

## Step 4: Start the checkout process

To start a new payment process with the Full SDK, call the `startCheckout` method inside the `onCreate()` function of the activity that initializes the SDK:

```kotlin
startCheckout(
  checkoutSession: "checkout_session",
  // Replace with your target country's ISO code (e.g., "US" for USA, "FR" for France). The complete list of country_codes is available on https://docs.y.uno/docs/country-coverage-yuno-sdk.
  country_code: "country_code_iso",
  callbackPaymentState: ((String?) -> Unit)?,
  merchantSessionId: String? = null //Optional - Default null
)
```

Below is a description of the required parameters to start the checkout.

| Parameter              | Description                                                                                                                                                                               |
| :--------------------- | :---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `checkoutSession`      | A unique identifier for the checkout session associated with the payment. It is required to initialize the payment process and grants access to the customer's available payment methods. |
| `country_code`         | Country code where the payment is performed. See [Country coverage](doc:country-coverage-yuno-sdk) for a complete list of supported countries and their codes.                            |
| `callbackPaymentState` | It's a function that returns the current payment process. You don't need to send this function if you don't need the result.                                                              |
| `merchantSessionId`    | An identifier used by the merchant to track the payment.                                                                                                                                  |

The possible states returned by the `callbackPaymentState` are presented below:

```kotlin
const val PAYMENT_STATE_SUCCEEDED = "SUCCEEDED"
const val PAYMENT_STATE_FAIL = "FAIL"
const val PAYMENT_STATE_PROCESSING = "PROCESSING"
const val PAYMENT_STATE_REJECT = "REJECT"
const val PAYMENT_STATE_INTERNAL_ERROR = "INTERNAL_ERROR"
const val PAYMENT_STATE_STATE_CANCELED_BY_USER = "CANCELED"
```

The following table provide additional information about the possible states:

| **State**        | **Description**                                                                                                                 | **Additional action required**                                                                                |
| ---------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `SUCCEEDED`      | The transaction or payment process was successfully completed without any errors.                                               | No.                                                                                                           |
| `FAIL`           | The transaction failed due to errors such as data validation issues, server connection failures, or technical/network problems. | Yes. Investigate the cause of failure (validation, network, server) and take corrective measures.             |
| `PROCESSING`     | The transaction is currently in progress, awaiting approval or verification.                                                    | No.                                                                                                           |
| `REJECT`         | The transaction was rejected due to reasons like insufficient funds or suspected fraudulent activity.                           | Yes. Inform the user of the rejection, provide the reason if possible, and suggest actions.                   |
| `INTERNAL_ERROR` | An unexpected internal error occurred within the system handling the payment process.                                           | Yes. Requires technical intervention to review the system, fix internal issues, and retry or inform the user. |
| `CANCELED`       | The user voluntarily canceled the transaction or abandoned the payment process.                                                 | No.                                                                                                           |

## Step 5: Add the SDK view to the checkout

When implementing the Full SDK, be sure to include the `PaymentMethodListView` in your layout to display the available payment methods. Additionally, use the `.setOnSelectedEvent` lambda function to notify your app when to enable or disable the pay button.

```xml
<com.yuno.payments.features.payment.ui.views.PaymentMethodListView
  android:id="@+id/list_payment_methods" 
  android:layout_width="match_parent"
	android:layout_height="wrap_content" />
```

## Step 6: Initiate the payment process

To start a payment process, you have to call the method `startPayment()`.

```kotlin
startPayment(
    showStatusYuno: Boolean,  
    callbackOTT: (String?) -> Unit = this::onTokenUpdated,  
    callBackTokenWithInformation: (OneTimeTokenModel?) -> Unit = this::onTokenComplete  
)

```

Below is a description of the required parameters to start the payment.

| Parameter                      | Description                                                                                                                                                            |
| :----------------------------- | :--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `showStatusYuno`               | A boolean that specifies whether the payment status should be displayed within the Yuno interface.                                                                     |
| `callbackOTT`                  | A required function that returns the updated one-time token (OTT) needed to complete the payment process. This token is required to complete the payment.              |
| `callBackTokenWithInformation` | A function that supplies detailed information about the one-time token, wrapped in a `OneTimeTokenModel` object, allowing for comprehensive handling of token details. |

## Step 7: Get the one-time token (OTT)

Once the customer fills out the requested data in Yuno's payment forms, you will obtain the one-time token, a required parameter to create a payment using the Yuno API.

The one-time token will be shared by Yuno using the `callbackOTT` function you provided in Step 6 when initiating the payment. The one-time token will be available in the `onActivityResult`.

> ðŸ“˜ Loader Configuration
>
> While Yuno receives the customer information and shares the one-time token, a loader can be displayed to improve the user experience. Yuno provides a default loader that can be used out of the box. However, merchants may choose to implement their own loader and are responsible for making the necessary configurations.

## Step 8: Create the payment

Once you receive the one-time token from [Step 7](doc:full-checkout-android#step-7-get-the-one-time-token-ott), you can create the payment using the [Create payment endpoint](https://docs.y.uno/reference/create-payment). To create the payment, use the `checkout_session` from [Step 3](doc:full-checkout-android#step-3-create-the-checkout-session) and the one-time token.

The response from the Create payment endpoint will include the parameter `sdk_action_required`, which defines if additional actions are required to finish the payment based on the payment type.

> ðŸš§ Continue Payment Method Integration
>
> Yuno **requires** you integrate the `continuePayment` method of the SDK after the payment is created because certain asynchronous payment methods require additional customer action to complete. The API will inform you of this scenario via the `sdk_action_required` field of the response, which will be returned as true. The `yuno.continuePayment()` function will display additional screens to customers, where they can carry out the necessary actions to complete the payment without you needing to handle every scenario.

## Step 9: Continue payment

Yuno requires integrating the SDK's `continuePayment` method after the payment is created, as certain asynchronous payment methods require additional customer actions to complete. The response from the [Create payment endpoint](https://docs.y.uno/reference/create-payment), from Step 8, will include a `sdk_action_required` field. If it returns `TRUE`, it means you need to call the `continuePayment()` function to show additional screens that allow the customer to complete the payment. Otherwise, this step is not necessary. You need to call `continuePayment` method as presented below:

```kotlin
continuePayment(
    showPaymentStatus: Boolean = true, // Optional â€“ Default true
    checkoutSession: String? = null,   // Optional â€“ Default null
    country_code: String? = null,       // Optional â€“ Default null
    callbackPaymentState: ((String?) -> Unit)? = null // Optional â€“ Default null
)
```

To show your payment status screens, you should send `FALSE` in the `showPaymentStatus` parameter. Then, get the payment state by callback.

## Render Mode integration

The Yuno SDK render mode provides advanced UI flexibility, allowing developers to integrate payment flows with complete control over the user interface while maintaining full SDK functionality. This mode returns fragments that can be used with both Jetpack Compose and traditional XML views.

### Main function: `startPaymentRender`

The `startPaymentRender` function initializes the payment flow in render mode, giving you granular control over UI presentation.

```kotlin
fun Activity.startPaymentRender(
    checkoutSession: String? = null,
    countryCode: String? = null,
    coroutineScope: CoroutineScope,
    paymentSelected: PaymentSelected,
    listener: YunoPaymentRenderListener,
): YunoPaymentFragmentController
```

#### Parameters

| Parameter         | Type                        | Required | Description                                   |
| ----------------- | --------------------------- | -------- | --------------------------------------------- |
| `checkoutSession` | `String?`                   | No       | ID of the previously created checkout session |
| `countryCode`     | `String?`                   | No       | Country code for regional configurations      |
| `coroutineScope`  | `CoroutineScope`            | Yes      | Coroutine scope for asynchronous operations   |
| `paymentSelected` | `PaymentSelected`           | Yes      | Selected payment method                       |
| `listener`        | `YunoPaymentRenderListener` | Yes      | Listener implementation to receive events     |

### Implementation example

```kotlin
class PaymentActivity : Activity() {
    
    private lateinit var fragmentController: YunoPaymentFragmentController
    
    private fun initializePayment() {
        fragmentController = startPaymentRender(
            checkoutSession = "your_checkout_session_id",
            countryCode = "US",
            coroutineScope = lifecycleScope,
            paymentSelected = PaymentSelected.CARD,
            listener = paymentRenderListener
        )
    }
}
```

### `YunoPaymentRenderListener` interface

Implement this interface to receive all events and views from the SDK during the payment flow.

```kotlin
class PaymentRenderListener : YunoPaymentRenderListener {
    
    override fun showView(fragment: Fragment) {
        // Display fragment in your UI container
        supportFragmentManager.beginTransaction()
            .replace(R.id.payment_container, fragment)
            .commit()
    }
    
    override fun returnStatus(resultCode: Int, paymentStatus: String) {
        // Handle final payment status
        when (paymentStatus) {
            "SUCCEEDED" -> handleSuccessfulPayment()
            "FAIL" -> handleFailedPayment()
            // Handle other states
        }
    }
    
    override fun returnOneTimeToken(oneTimeToken: String, additionalData: OneTimeTokenModel?) {
        // Process OTT in your backend, then continue the flow
        createPaymentInBackend(oneTimeToken) { result ->
            when (result) {
                is Success -> fragmentController.continuePayment()
                is Error -> handlePaymentError(result.error)
            }
        }
    }
    
    override fun loadingListener(isLoading: Boolean) {
        // Show/hide loading indicators
        progressBar.visibility = if (isLoading) View.VISIBLE else View.GONE
    }
}
```

### `YunoPaymentFragmentController` interface

Control the payment flow using the returned controller instance.

#### Methods

* **`submitForm()`**: Submits the current form when available
* **`continuePayment()`**: Continues the payment flow after backend OTT processing

```kotlin
// Submit form when ready
fragmentController.submitForm()

// Continue after successful backend processing
fragmentController.continuePayment()
```

### Integration benefits

#### UI flexibility

* **Compose and XML compatible**: Works with both Jetpack Compose and traditional XML views
* **Complete control**: You decide where and how to display each view
* **Custom integration**: Easy integration with existing app design

#### Flow control

* **Custom submit logic**: Control when to submit forms
* **Backend integration**: Process OTT on your backend before continuing

### Complete integration example

```kotlin
class PaymentActivity : ComponentActivity() {
    
    private lateinit var fragmentController: YunoPaymentFragmentController
    
    override fun onCreate(savedInstanceState: Bundle?) {
        super.onCreate(savedInstanceState)
        
        fragmentController = startPaymentRender(
            checkoutSession = checkoutSessionId,
            countryCode = "US", 
            coroutineScope = lifecycleScope,
            paymentSelected = PaymentSelected.CARD,
            listener = object : YunoPaymentRenderListener {
                override fun showView(fragment: Fragment) {
                    supportFragmentManager.beginTransaction()
                        .replace(R.id.payment_fragment_container, fragment)
                        .commit()
                }
                
                override fun returnOneTimeToken(oneTimeToken: String, additionalData: OneTimeTokenModel?) {
                    // Process in backend and continue
                    processPaymentToken(oneTimeToken) {
                        fragmentController.continuePayment()
                    }
                }
                
                override fun returnStatus(resultCode: Int, paymentStatus: String) {
                    handlePaymentResult(paymentStatus)
                }
                
                override fun loadingListener(isLoading: Boolean) {
                    updateLoadingState(isLoading)
                }
            }
        )
    }
}
```

> ðŸš§ Lifecycle Management
>
> Ensure that the `CoroutineScope` is tied to the Activity/Fragment lifecycle to prevent memory leaks and ensure proper cleanup.

## Complementary features

Yuno Android SDK provides additional services and configurations you can use to improve customers' experience. Use the [SDK customizations](doc:sdk-customizations-android) to change the SDK appearance to match your brand or to configure the loader.

### `styles`

With the `styles` customization option, you can define global visual styles like through a `YunoStyles` object. It lets you apply consistent branding across the SDK by customizing button appearance and typography.

```kotlin
data class YunoStyles(
    val buttonStyles: YunoButtonStyles? = null,
    val fontFamily: FontFamily? = null
)
```

| Parameter      | Description                                             |
| :------------- | :------------------------------------------------------ |
| `buttonStyles` | Customizes the primary buttons displayed in the SDK.    |
| `fontFamily`   | Sets the font family used across all SDK text elements. |

The `YunoButtonStyles` object lets you define specific settings for button appearance:

```kotlin
data class YunoButtonStyles(
    val backgroundColor: Color? = null,
    val contentColor: Color? = null,
    val cornerRadius: Dp? = null,
    val elevation: Dp? = null,
    val padding: Dp? = null,
