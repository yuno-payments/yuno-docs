Follow this step-by-step guide to implement and enable Yuno's Full Web SDK functionality in your application.

## Step 1: Include the library in your project

Before proceeding with the Full SDK implementation, please refer to the [Yuno SDK Integration Guide](doc:yuno-sdk-integration-guide) for detailed instructions on how to properly integrate the SDK into your project. 

The integration guide provides three flexible methods:

1. Direct HTML script inclusion
2. Dynamic JavaScript injection
3. NPM module installation

Choose the integration method that best suits your development workflow and technical requirements. After completing the SDK integration, you can proceed with the following steps to implement the full checkout functionality.

<HTMLBlock>{`

  <div class="infoBlockContainer ">
    <div class="verticalLine"></div>
    <div>
      <h3>TypeScript library</h3>
      <div class="contentContainer">
        <p>
          If you are using TypeScript, Yuno provides a <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/@yuno-payments/sdk-web-types">library</a> that you can use to see all available methods available in the Yuno Web SDK.
        </p>
      </div>
    </div>
  </div>
</body>
`}</HTMLBlock>

## Step 2: Initialize SDK with the public key

In your JavaScript application, create an instance of the `Yuno` class by providing a valid **PUBLIC\_API\_KEY**. Check the [Get your API credentials](ref:get-your-api-credentials) guide. 

Like the example below, use the initialized class that is attributed to the `yuno`constant.

```javascript
const yuno = await Yuno.initialize(PUBLIC_API_KEY)
```

## Step 3: Start the checkout process

To start the checkout, you'll use the function `yuno.startCheckout`, providing the necessary parameters. 

The following table lists all required parameters and their descriptions. For optional parameters, go to [Complementary Features](https://docs.y.uno/docs/full-checkout-sdk#complementary-features).

<Table align={["left","left"]}>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>
        Parameter
      </th>

      <th>
        Description
      </th>
    </tr>
  </thead>

  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>
        `checkoutSession`
      </td>

      <td>
        Refers to the current payment's [checkout session](ref:create-checkout-session).\
        `Example: '438413b7-4921-41e4-b8f3-28a5a0141638'`
      </td>
    </tr>

    <tr>
      <td>
        `countryCode`
      </td>

      <td>
        This parameter specifies the country for which the payment process is being set up.\
        Use an `ENUM` value representing the desired country code. You can find the full list of supported countries and their corresponding codes on the [Country Coverage](doc:country-coverage-yuno-sdk)  page.
      </td>
    </tr>

    <tr>
      <td>
        `language`
      </td>

      <td>
        Defines the language to be used in the payment forms. You can set it to one of the available language options: es (Spanish), en (English), pt (Portuguese), fil (Filipino), id (Indonesian), ms (Malay), or th (Thai).
      </td>
    </tr>

    <tr>
      <td>
        `onLoading`
      </td>

      <td>
        Required to receive notifications about server calls or loading events during the payment process. 
      </td>
    </tr>

    <tr>
      <td>
        `showLoading`
      </td>

      <td>
        Control the visibility of the Yuno loading/spinner page during the payment process. By default, it's `true`.
      </td>
    </tr>

    <tr>
      <td>
        `issuersFormEnable`
      </td>

      <td>
        Enables the issuer's form. By default, it's `true`.
      </td>
    </tr>

    <tr>
      <td>
        `showPaymentStatus`
      </td>

      <td>
        Shows the Yuno Payment Status page. You can use this option when continuing a payment as well. By default, it's `true`.
      </td>
    </tr>

    <tr>
      <td>
        `card.isCreditCardProcessingOnly`
      </td>

      <td>
        Enables you to ensure that all card transactions are processed as credit only. This option is helpful in markets where cards can act as both credit and debit.\
        To enable, set the `isCreditCardProcessingOnly` to `true` to ensure that all card transactions are processed as credit.\
        This parameter is not required.
      </td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</Table>

```javascript
yuno.startCheckout({
  checkoutSession: '438413b7-4921-41e4-b8f3-28a5a0141638',
  /**
   * The complete list of country codes is available on https://docs.y.uno/docs/country-coverage-yuno-sdk
  */
  country_code: "FR",
  language: 'fr',
  showLoading: true,
  issuersFormEnable: true,
  showPaymentStatus: true,
	/**
   * Set isCreditCardProcessingOnly as true to process all card transactions are credit
   * isCreditCardProcessingOnly: true | false | undefined
  */
  card: { 
    isCreditCardProcessingOnly: true,
  }
  onLoading: (args) => {
    console.log(args);
  }
  async yunoCreatePayment(oneTimeToken) {
  	/**
    * The createPayment function calls the backend to create a payment in Yuno. 
    * It uses the following endpoint https://docs.y.uno/reference/create-payment
  	*/
    await createPayment({ oneTimeToken, checkoutSession })
    yuno.continuePayment({ showPaymentStatus: true })
  },
})
```

<HTMLBlock>{`
<body>
  <div class="infoBlockContainer ">
    <div class="verticalLine"></div>
    <div>
      <h3>Rendering mode</h3>
      <div class="contentContainer">
        <p>
          By default, Yuno SDK renders as a modal. However, you can specify the element where the SDK will render. For additional information, access the <a href="/docs/complementary-features-full-sdk#mode-of-form-rendering">Render mode</a> under the complementary complementary features page.
        </p>
      </div>
    </div>
  </div>
</body>
`}</HTMLBlock>

## Step 4: Mount the SDK

Display the payment methods by using the function `yuno.mountCheckout()` by selecting an HTML element and using a valid CSS selector (`#`, `.`, `[data-*]`)

```javascript
/**
 * Mount checkout in browser DOM
 */
yuno.mountCheckout()
```

If you want to set a default payment method, use the following code to mount it:

```javascript
/**
 * Mount checkout in browser DOM with a payment method selected by default
 * @optional
 */
yuno.mountCheckout({
  /**
   * Optional, only needed if you would like this method type selected by default
   * Can be one of 'PAYPAL' | 'PIX' | 'APPLE_PAY' | 'GOOGLE_PAY' | CARD
   */
  paymentMethodType: PAYMENT_METHOD_TYPE,
  /**
   * Optional
   * Vaulted token related to payment method type
   */
  vaultedToken: VAULTED_TOKEN,
})
```

## Step 5: Initiate the payment process

After the user has selected a payment method remember to call `yuno.startPayment()` to initiate the payment flow. Below you will find an example where `yuno.startPayment()` is called when the user clicks on `button-pay`:

```javascript
const PayButton = document.querySelector('#button-pay')

PayButton.addEventListener('click', () => {
  yuno.startPayment()
})
```

## Step 6: Get the OTT (one-time token)

Once the customer fills out the requested data in Yuno's payment forms, the SDK provides the one-time token. The configuration function `yuno.CreatePayment(oneTimeToken)` is then triggered with the one-time token.

```javascript
 yunoCreatePayment(oneTimeToken)
```

You can also use tokenWithInformation to receive any additional info given by the customer in the checkout such as installments or document type/number.

```javascript
yunoCreatePayment(oneTimeToken, tokenWithInformation)
```

<HTMLBlock>{`
<body>
  <div class="infoBlockContainer alert">
    <div class="verticalLineAlert"></div>
    <div>
      <h3>Important</h3>
      <div class="contentContainer">
        <p>
					The merchant is responsible for handling the loader. Yuno offers an option to use our loader; however, the merchant can use their own loader and must make the corresponding configurations.
        </p>
      </div>
    </div>
  </div>
</body>
`}</HTMLBlock>

## Step 7: Create the Payment

Once you have completed the steps described before, you can create a payment. The back-to-back payment creation must be carried out using the [Create Payment endpoint](https://docs.y.uno/reference/create-payment). The merchant should call their backend to create the payment within Yuno, using the one-time token and the checkout session.

`}</HTMLBlock>

<HTMLBlock>{`
<body>
  <div class="infoBlockContainer">
    <div class="verticalLine"></div>
    <div>
      <h3>Continue method</h3>
      <div class="contentContainer">
        <p>
          Yuno <b>requires</b> you integrate the <code>continuePayment</code> method of the SDK after the payment is created because certain asynchronous payment methods require additional action from the customer to complete it. The API will inform you of this scenario via the <code>sdk_action_required</code> field of the response, which will be returned as true. The <code>yuno.continuePayment()</code> function will display the additional screens to the customers, where they can carry out the necessary actions to complete the payment without needing you to handle every scenario 
        </p>
      </div>
    </div>
  </div>
</body>
`}</HTMLBlock>

## `continuePayment` return value or null

For payment methods that require merchant-side action (e.g., when the payment provider requires a redirect URL in a webview), the `await yuno.continuePayment()` method will return either an object with the following structure or null:

```typescript
{
  action: 'REDIRECT_URL'
  type: string
  redirect: {
    init_url: string
    success_url: string
    error_url: string
  }
} | null
```

When the method returns an object, it allows you to handle your application's payment flows that require custom redirect handling. When it returns null, no additional merchant-side action is needed.

        * **String (Deprecated)**: Provide the ID or selector of the element where the SDK should be mounted.
        * **Object**: Specify the elements for mounting the APM and action forms. You need to provide the element for the `apmForm`, which is where the APM is displayed, and the element for the `actionForm`, where the Continue Payment button appears. This button triggers a modal that shows the steps to complete a payment with a provider. For example, with PIX, it displays a QR code.
      </td>

      <td>
        Define specific settings for the credit card form:  

        * `type`: `step` or `extends`
        * `styles`: You can edit card form styles. Only you should write css, then it will be injected into the iframe.
        * `cardSaveEnable`: Show checkbox for save/enroll card. The default value is false.
        * `texts`: Custom texts in the Card forms buttons.
      </td>

```javascript
yuno.startCheckout({
  card: {
    type: "extends",
    styles: '',
    cardSaveEnable: false,
    texts: {}
  },
})
```

#### Save card for future payments

In addition, you can display a checkbox for saving or enrolling cards using the `cardSaveEnable: true`. Below are examples of the checkbox for both card form renders.

<Image align="center" src="https://files.readme.io/37b2e00b0c6a3d31bceb42b26b1b433c8d30e61d947a93298dd90c466bde004b-complementary-features.png" />

#### Rendering modes

Below you find screenshots presenting the difference between the following: 

* Render modes `modal` and `elements` for the payment method list
* Render modes `step` and `extends` for the credit card form

<Image align="center" src="https://files.readme.io/b56fe6dfdebaee158495dea86d5269d865fae2dfcb81eb8b34879f9e5e737f0e-caracteristicas_Complemetarias_web_1.png" />

You also can choose one of the render options for the card form, `step` and `extends`:

<Image align="center" src="https://files.readme.io/08654f8fa7b638641cb1b9f5b882a75537a9e449fff4960cf560c1ec5b3efb74-caracteristicas_Complemetarias_web_2.png" />

#### Text payment form buttons

| Parameter | Description                                                                                    |
| :-------- | :--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `texts`   | Provide custom text for payment form buttons to match your application's language or branding. |

```javascript
yuno.startCheckout({
  texts: {
    customerForm?: {
      submitButton?: string;
    }
    paymentOtp?: {
      sendOtpButton?: string;
    }
  }
})
```

#### Persist credit card form to retry payments

If a transaction is rejected, you can use the credit card form to retry a payment after the customer has entered the credit card details. To do that, you will need to: 

1. Add the following parameter while initializing the SDK to persist the credit card form after the one-time use token is created: 
   ```javascript
   yuno.startCheckout({
     automaticallyUnmount: false,
   })
   ```
2. In case the transaction is rejected, you will need to: 
   1. Execute the method `yuno.notifyError() `to delete the previously entered CVV for the first transaction
   2. Create a new checkout session and update the SDK with the new one by executing `yuno.updateCheckoutSession(checkoutsession)`
3. Continue with the new checkout and one-time use token with the regular payment flow.

#### Hide Pay button

You can hide the Pay button when presenting the card or customer data form. To control this feature, you'll set `showPayButton` to `false` when starting the checkout with the `startCheckout` function. The code block below presents an example of how to hide the payment button:

```javascript
yuno.startCheckout({
  /**
   * Hide (false) or show (true) the customer or card form pay button
   * @default true
   * @optional
   */
  showPayButton: false,
})
```

The following images present examples of the Customer Data Form with and without the Pay button:

<Image align="center" src="https://files.readme.io/873a709f1c3dce3c3dcc13dd4fd3cc9b5a8ecdf812c3b631f3cf8700177cc5cf-Card_boton.png" />

The following images present examples of the Card Form with and without the Pay button:

<Image align="center" src="https://files.readme.io/b8b5e51ab3f5907786b802cb782a71e043f4ec18475b6e5b6d4dd052c6dc4e37-Card_boton_1.png" />

If you hide the Pay button, you will need to start the one-time token creation through your code. To create the one-time token and continue the payment in your backend, call the `submitOneTimeTokenForm` function. The code block below presents how to use the `submitOneTimeTokenForm` function.

```javascript
/**
 * This function triggers the same functionality that is called when the customer clicks on the pay form button.  This doesn't work on the step Card form
 */
yuno.submitOneTimeTokenForm()
```
