## Choose your integration method

Let's help you choose the integration method that best fits your needs. Each approach has specific advantages, and selecting the right one depends on your development environment, technical requirements, and preferences.

* **[Method 1 (HTML)](#1-add-the-sdk-script-directly-in-html)**: Add a single script tag to your HTML file. This is the simplest method, ideal for basic implementations and quick prototypes
* **[Method 2 (Dynamic JavaScript)](#2-inject-the-sdk-dynamically-using-javascript)**: Load the SDK programmatically with custom error handling and loading states. Best for applications needing more control over the integration
* **[Method 3 (NPM)](#3-use-the-npm-module)**: Use our NPM package in modern JavaScript applications. This is our recommended approach, with dependency management, tree-shaking, and TypeScript support

### 1. Add the SDK script directly in HTML

The simplest way to integrate the Yuno SDK is by adding a `<script>` tag to your HTML file. This method provides a quick implementation while maintaining proper asynchronous loading. The SDK exposes an event that notifies when it's fully loaded, ensuring you can safely initialize and use its features at the right time.

> ðŸ“˜ Event Listener Timing
>
> While the `defer` attribute ensures the script is executed after the HTML is parsed, it doesn't guarantee that the SDK script will always load last. In some cases, if the SDK loads faster than expected and the event listener is declared afterward, the `yuno-sdk-ready` event may have already fired â€” and your listener won't catch it. To prevent this, always define the listener before loading the SDK script.

```html
<!-- First, set up the event listener -->
<script>
  window.addEventListener('yuno-sdk-ready', () => {
    console.log('SDK loaded'); // The SDK is ready to use
    await yuno.initialize('publicKey');
  });
</script>

<!-- Then load the SDK -->
<script defer src="https://sdk-web.y.uno/v1.1/main.js"></script>
```
