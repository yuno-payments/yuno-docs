Checkout builder is a drop-in UI for web and mobile, with a no-code interface for product and payments teams. 

The dashboard features a no-code interface enabling you to simply drag-and-drop payment methods and checkout modules and create conditions that determine when and how they are displayed and processed on your checkout.

Before you can configure your checkout, you need to integrate at least one payment processor. For help or more information on how to do this, please view more here.
