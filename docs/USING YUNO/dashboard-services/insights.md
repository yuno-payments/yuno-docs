## Navigating Insights

Yuno Insights organizes your data into three distinct tabs, each providing a unique perspective:

* **Overview**: A high-level overview of your payent processing, including total payment volume, average ticket size, and conversion rate trends.
* **Volume**: Details on payment volume, refunds and chargebacks. Volume is divided by provider, payment method, country, and other relevant factors.
* **Conversion rate**: Performance metrics including approval rates, retry attempts, validation, and more. This screen is vital to track coversion rates, and therefore, payment success across your operation.

## Informed decision-making

The data presented within Yuno Insights is strategically organized around two core facets:

* Volume: Data aligned with business metrics to understand the overall flow and value of your transactions.
* Performance: Operational efficiency data to gauge the effectiveness and success rate of your payment processes.

Analyzing the available data from these two angles will allow you to easily extract valuable data, including:

* Overall and segmented conversion rates (by payment method and provider) to identify top-performing options.
* Detailed information on declined transactions, helping you understand and address reasons for non-conversion.
* Clear visibility into transaction volume trends, allowing you to track growth and identify fluctuations.
