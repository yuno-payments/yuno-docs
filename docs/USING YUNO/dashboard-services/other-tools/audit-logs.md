Yuno audit logs streamline management tasks through several features:

- **Comprehensive activity logging**: Track every action carried out within the dashboard, when it occurred, and the changes made. This level of detail ensures transparency and accountability in all operations.
- **User tracking**: Audit logs ensure every action is traceable to a specific individual, enabling you to pinpoint the cause of any change and analyze user behavior for continuous improvement.
- **Detailed technical data**: Clicking the **Event** tag for each action (such as "Updated" or "Created") provides additional information for developers and technical users, including the IP address of the device used to make the change and the API endpoint's response body.
- **Advanced search capabilities**: Select **Add filters** to quickly narrow your search. Choose from a variety of filters, including accounts, dates, team members, and more to efficiently locate the data you need.

Audit logs are essential for Yuno's security and compliance, ensuring every action is recorded. This provides critical control, safeguards your operations, and facilitates root cause analysis after user changes.
