The dashboard's [Account management](https://dashboard.y.uno/accounts) section lets you create, edit, and review organizational accounts with ease. You can access it by clicking on your profile image and selecting **See all your accounts**. Creating multiple accounts is handy for managing access, upholding security, and streamlining business operations.

## Advantages of creating multiple accounts

* **Granular access management**: Multiple accounts allow fine-tuning of access permissions. Each account can represent countries, franchises, business units, or any segmentation you require. This enhances the security and management of your dashboard.
* **Diverse user roles**: Users can access and engage with multiple accounts, each with its own role and permissions. Refer to [Team and roles](doc:teams-and-roles) for an overview of role allocation and management.

## Streamlining your experience

* **Seamless filtering**: The **Add filters** menu found inside many of the dashboard's sections allows you to filter and combine information from one or more accounts. This enables effortless data visualization based on your organization's needs without managing multiple credentials.
* **Set preferred account**: The Account management section allows you to select a preferred account, which sets it as the default filter selection when using the dashboard. This ensures you see the most relevant information regardless of how many accounts exist on your system.

## Unique account IDs

Each account within the dashboard will have unique Account IDs for both Live mode and Test mode. The Account IDs can be found by clicking on the account name inside the Account management section, or through the Developers section.
