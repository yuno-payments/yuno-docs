The **Team and roles** section allows you to create teams, define roles, and assign permissions with precision. This setup supports structured collaboration and enforces access controls to maintain a secure and organized environment. To access this section within the Yuno dashboard, click your profile image and select **Team and roles**.

## Harnessing the power of teams

- **Building dynamic teams**: Yuno allows you to create flexible teams composed of users from different accounts. A single user can be part of multiple teams, each with unique roles tailored to their responsibilities.
- **Cross-account participation**: Yuno supports cross-account collaboration, enabling users to contribute to teams across different accounts. This promotes a unified, efficient workflow across your organization.
- **Customizable roles**: Roles define each member's level of access and responsibilities. Yuno offers a set of predefined roles with specific permissions, ensuring that every user has the appropriate tools and access to perform their tasks.

## Working with teams

The **Team members** tab allows you to invite new members and manage existing ones. The actions available to you will depend on your assigned permissions.

- **Invite members**: Send one or more invitations via email and assign roles to new members.
- **Member management**: Click the three-dot icon next to a member's name to edit their role or delete them from the team.

Use **Add filters** to sort between your [accounts](https://docs.y.uno/docs/account-management).

## The dynamics of roles

Defining clear roles and permissions strengthens the security of your operations. Each team member works within a specific scope, reducing the risk of accidental errors or unauthorized access. With Yuno's Team and roles management, your team can stay focused and productive. Roles give individuals the access they need to do their jobs efficiently, while keeping workflows organized and secure.

There are two types of roles in Yuno:

- **Default roles**: Yuno offers a set of predefined roles, each encapsulating a distinct array of permissions. These default roles serve as a foundation for streamlined team functioning.
- **Custom role creation**: Yuno's flexibility extends to crafting custom roles. Tailor permissions to suit your precise requirements, allowing your teams to function optimally while adhering to the principle of least privilege.

There are 6 types of default roles:

| Roles     | Description                                                                        |
| :-------- | :--------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Admin     | An Admin user has access to all features in the dashboard.                         |
| Agent     | An Agent user can view and take actions on payments.                               |
| Developer | A Developer user can view and take actions on integrations and webhooks.           |
| Read only | A Read-only user can view all features in the dashboard.                           |
| Custodian | Assign this role when you invite Yuno team experts to join your team.              |
| IAM Admin | Users with this role manage access and security settings like SSO, MFA, and roles. |

The **Roles management** tab shows the permissions assigned to each role. Select **Create role** to define custom roles tailored to your team's specific needs.
