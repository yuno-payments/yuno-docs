When you move your Yuno account from test mode (Sandbox) to live mode, you will put your payment system into production, making it possible to process real transactions.

## Checklist

Before enabling live mode, it is essential you have accomplished some steps in the Yuno integration process. Consult this checklist to guarantee a smooth transition while getting ready to go live with your integration.

## Going live

Once you have access to your credentials, configured payment connections, and successfully tested all functionalities in sandbox environment, you are ready to enable live mode.

### Enable live mode

1. First, you must activate your account by clicking on **Activate account** in the [Yuno Merchant Dashboard](https://dashboard.y.uno/).

> ðŸ“˜ Note
>
> The account activation process requires you to provide some profile information and may take 2-4 weeks. In case of any problems, please get in touch with <a href="mailto:support@y.uno">Yuno support</a>. Meanwhile, you can continue using the sandbox environment for testing.

2. After starting the activation process, your Dashboard status will change to **Verifying account status**.

3. Once activation is completed, Yuno will contact you, and you will have access to your **Production** environment credentials. Thus, you can switch to the Production environment through your Merchant Dashboard:
