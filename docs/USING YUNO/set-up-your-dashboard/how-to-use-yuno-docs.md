Yuno Docs is built with Readme.io, providing all the needed information to use Yuno API. In addition, in the [API Reference](ref:introduction), you can also perform requests to understand and test Yuno API directly through your browser.

On the left panels of API Reference, all sections with  HTTP verb tags provide code examples and the option to perform requests:

Here we are going to use the [Create Customer](ref:create-customer) case to explore the available information and operations you can perform directly with Yuno Docs.

## Page overview

Accessing the [Create Customer](ref:create-customer) page, or another page with an HTTP verb tag, you will see:

1. A description with relevant information about the request and your request history. All tests performed are listed in the **Your Request History** area, where you can view requests for up to 30 days.
2. Parameter fields to edit your request data accompanied by a brief description. By entering data into these fields, Yuno Docs automatically generate the request code for you. The generated code is shown on the code block shown in 6.
3. Response list with possible responses for the request and its response body description.
4. Available languages to generate the request code.
5. API credentials fields. You must provide your credentials here to successfully test your requests to the Yuno API.
6. Testing request area with requests and responses code examples. It presents the Request card on top and the Response Card on the bottom. The generated code by entering data into the parameter fields is provided here.
