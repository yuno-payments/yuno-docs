Yuno provides a powerful dual environment feature: Test Mode (Sandbox) and Live Mode (Production). Test Mode allows for safe experimentation, while Live Mode is where your customers interact with your live services.

Yuno's dual environment empowers your business to excel in both testing and real-world scenarios. Seamlessly switch between modes using a convenient toggle under a single set of credentials, maintaining top-tier security and functionality.

This guide will walk you through the transition from Test Mode to Live Mode, ensuring a smooth and secure experience for your business and customers.

## Understanding the environments

Yuno has two distinct environments, each serving a specific purpose:

* **Test Mode (Sandbox):** Upon registration, your organization is assigned an "Inactive" status. This status provides access exclusively to Test Mode. It allows you to explore the dashboard's features, learn about its functionalities, and experiment without affecting your live operations. Test Mode is an invaluable tool to try out new configurations and features without worrying about the outcome.
* **Live Mode (Production environment):** To access Live Mode, where real customer interactions occur, you need to initiate an activation request. Once the account is active, the production environment enables real-world operations while ensuring the utmost security and performance. This is where the lessons learned using the Sandbox environment are applied to provide a world-class experience to your customers.

## Transitioning to Live Mode

1. **Requesting activation:** To access Live Mode, submit a request for activation from the dashboard's home page. This request triggers the transition process, and your organization's status will change from "Inactive" to "Under Verification". Test mode will remain available while the activation takes place.
2. **Verification process:** Yuno's verification process is typically complete within a few hours, and it's essential to ensure the accuracy and safety of your information. If any additional information is required, our team will promptly reach out for details.
3. **Access granted:** Once the verification is complete, you'll be granted Live Mode access within the dashboard.

## Seamless environment switching

Switching between Sandbox and Production environments is remarkably simple:

* **One-click switching:** The dashboard's **Test mode** toogle lets you switch environments in an instant, ensuring smooth navigation and ease of access.
* **Single username and password:** One set of credential will allow you to use both environments without dealing with multiple passwords or a segmented experience.
