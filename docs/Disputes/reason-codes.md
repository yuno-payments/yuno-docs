A chargeback reason code is a short alphanumeric code assigned by the issuing bank to explain why a customer disputed a transaction. These codes help merchants understand the issue and respond accordingly. While merchants can challenge chargebacks by providing evidence, the reason code might change if new information arises during the dispute process. Major card networks like Visa, Mastercard, American Express, Discover, and Diners each have their own set of reason codes.

The following table shows the possible reason codes for each Chargeback that you'll find in each transaction. You'll be able to find the associated `response_code` in each [transaction](ref:transaction#chargebacks-specific-response_codes) webhook. Also, in each chargeback transaction you'll find the [raw reason code](doc:providers-reason-codes) from the card schemes.
