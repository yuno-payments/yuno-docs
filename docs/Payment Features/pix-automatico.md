## Overview

Pix Automático is the Central Bank of Brazil’s new merchant-initiated recurring-payment feature built on the ubiquitous Pix instant-payment network. Since its launch in late 2020, Pix has become Brazilians’ favorite way to pay—handling over **26 trillion BRL** in transactions last year—and is available 24/7 across all banking apps and digital wallets  [oai\_citation:0‡reuters.com](https://www.reuters.com/world/americas/brazils-pix-set-next-leap-with-launch-recurring-payments-2025-06-04/?utm_source=chatgpt.com). On **June 16, 2025**, Pix Automático went live, enabling businesses to collect **subscription-style** or **installment** payments with a single one-time customer authorization—no credit cards or manual debit mandates required. Early estimates project up to **$30 billion USD** in e-commerce volume over the next two years via this new feature.

Pix Automático is a Pix-based payment method designed for recurring charges. Unlike regular Pix flows where the customer initiates each transaction, Pix Automático allows **automated debits** from the payer’s account after a **one-time authorization**. Think of it as Pix-native direct debit, ideal for subscriptions, monthly bills, and other recurring payments.

This flow reduces friction for end users while helping merchants minimize late payments and improve collection success rates.

## Flow

1. **Subscription**\
   The merchant creates a subscription in Yuno by calling the Payments API endpoint and presenting the authorization flow (e.g., render QR code). The customer approves once, defining amount parameters, billing cycle, and duration.

2. **Recurring Payment Requests**\
   For each billing cycle, the merchant submits a payment-order request referencing the enrollment ID. The customer’s bank validates the request against the original consent and executes the transfer automatically.

3. **Monitoring & Retries**\
   On failure for each payment, the merchant can perform up to 3 retries over a 7-day window.

4. **Cancellation & Reporting**\
   When an enrollment is canceled—by customer action or via Yuno’s API—no further orders are sent. Comprehensive reporting endpoints support reconciliation of successful charges, failures, and refunds.
