## Overview

Pix AutomÃ¡tico is the Central Bank of Brazilâ€™s new merchant-initiated recurring-payment feature built on the ubiquitous Pix instant-payment network. Since its launch in late 2020, Pix has become Braziliansâ€™ favorite way to payâ€”handling over **26 trillion BRL** in transactions last yearâ€”and is available 24/7 across all banking apps and digital wallets. On **June 16, 2025**, Pix AutomÃ¡tico went live, enabling businesses to collect **subscription-style** or **installment** payments with a single one-time customer authorizationâ€”no credit cards or manual debit mandates required. Early estimates project up to **$30 billion USD** in e-commerce volume over the next two years via this new feature.

Pix AutomÃ¡tico is a Pix-based payment method designed for recurring charges. Unlike regular Pix flows where the customer initiates each transaction, Pix AutomÃ¡tico allows **automated debits** from the payerâ€™s account after a **one-time authorization**. Think of it as Pix-native direct debit, ideal for subscriptions, monthly bills, and other recurring payments.

This flow reduces friction for end users while helping merchants minimize late payments and improve collection success rates.

Due to Brazil's central bank regulations, all future subscription payment orders **must** comply with the parameters defined in the payment/subscription creation sectionâ€”billing cycle, amount (fixed or variable), duration, retry rules, credit-line access, etc. If any payment request deviates from these rules (for example, an incorrect amount, an unauthorized billing cycle, or an expired enrollment), the customerâ€™s bank will reject the transaction and the payment will fail .

To ensure reliable processing, each recurring payment order must:

* **Match the authorized amount** (or stay within the variable limits youâ€™ve defined).
* **Adhere to the agreed billing cycle** (weekly, monthly, quarterly, semi-annual, or annual).
* **Respect the subscription duration** (fixed-term or open-ended) and not exceed the approved number of executions.
* **Follow the retry policy** (up to 3 retries over a 7-day window after a failure).

Any violation of these rules results in an automatic failure of the payment request.

## Flow

1. **Subscription**\
   The merchant creates a subscription in Yuno by calling the Payments API endpoint and presenting the authorization flow (e.g., render QR code). The customer approves once, defining amount parameters, billing cycle, and duration.

2. **Recurring Payment Requests**\
   For each billing cycle, the merchant submits a payment-order request referencing the enrollment ID. The customerâ€™s bank validates the request against the original consent and executes the transfer automatically.

3. **Monitoring & Retries**\
   On failure for each payment, the merchant can perform up to 3 retries over a 7-day window.

4. **Cancellation & Reporting**\
   When an enrollment is canceledâ€”by customer action or via Yunoâ€™s APIâ€”no further orders are sent. Comprehensive reporting endpoints support reconciliation of successful charges, failures, and refunds.

### Important notes

* You cannot send the payment on the exact billing date. It will be rejected.
* If the subscription starts on the 31st, and a month has no 31st, use the 1st of the next month as the billing date.
* The `subscription_id` is linked to the contract, not to the customer. Treat it as a reusable payment method.
* You can set a maximum value for each installment when the subscription is created.

### Next steps

Once you understand how Pix AutomÃ¡tico works, you can start integrating by using our payment and subscription APIs.

* [Retrieve or cancel a subscription](https://docs.y.uno/reference/retrieve-subscription)

You can also explore retry logic, test scenarios, and cancellation flows in the following reference guides.

If you plan to handle recurring payments programmatically, we recommend starting with the merchant-managed flow and defining your own billing logic. Yuno orchestration is available for cases where you prefer to offload scheduling and retries.

Pix AutomÃ¡tico is currently available for merchants collecting from users with Brazilian bank accounts. Make sure to validate your customer's eligibility and always follow the correct charge timing windows for each subscription cycle.
