In the **QR Code & Instant Payment** journey, Yuno presents a single QR code that both charges the customer immediately and enrolls them for all future recurring payments in one seamless step. When the customer scans the QR, their banking app processes the first installment and simultaneously captures their consent for subsequent automated charges, removing the need for any additional approvals or manual input.

After the initial scan and payment, each **subsequent request** is send by the merchant via Yuno and validated automatically by the customerâ€™s bank against the original consent, ensuring fast, reliable transfers without further customer interaction. This flow maximizes conversion and simplifies subscription management by combining enrollment and payment into a single user action.
