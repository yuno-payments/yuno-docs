## Characteristics

The Secure Fields SDK has the following characteristics:

* **Prebuilt UI Components**: Use the prebuilt UI to collect card information.
* **Automatic Formatting and Validation**: Fields format and validate card data.
* **Customizable UI**: You can customize the Secure Fields design to maintain your brand's look and feel.
* **Tailored Checkout Experience**: Choose which fields to show customers, highlighting incomplete fields and errors.

## Payment Security

Secure Fields SDK enhances your checkout experience by simplifying payment collection and improving security with the following features:

* **PCI Compliance**: Secure Fields follow PCI security standards.
* **Tokenization**: Payment details are tokenized, so sensitive data never touches your server.
* **Data Protection**: Prevents data breaches and ensures customer payment information security.

## Payment workflow

The following steps describe the integration process of Secure Fields SDK to perform payments.

> ðŸ“˜ Card Payments Only
>
> The Secure Fields SDK is designed to acept payments using cards. If you need to perform a payment using another payment method or a previously saved card, you need to choose use another Yuno integration:
>
> - [Full SDK](/docs/secure-fields-payment)
> - [Lite SDK](/docs/secure-fields-payment)  
> - [Direct Flow](/docs/secure-fields-payment)


### Step 1: Create a customer

First, create a customer. After you create a customer, you can associate payment methods to their account. You can skip this step if you already have a customer ID received from a previous customer creation.

Use the [Create Customer](ref:create-customer) endpoint to create new customers and get a customer `id`. The customer `id` will be used in the following steps.

### Step 2: Create a checkout session

Next, create a checkout session. You have to create a new checkout session for every new payment. This session provides access to all available payment methods (previously enrolled or not) for a specific customer. 

Use the [Create Checkout Session](ref:create-checkout-session) endpoint and provide the customer `id` to get a new `checkout_session`.

### Step 3: Display payment methods

Query the available payment methods using the [Retrieve Payment Methods](ref:retrieve-payment-methods-for-checkout) endpoint using the `checkout_session`. Show these methods to the customer so they can select their preferred payment method to execute the payment.

> ðŸ“˜ Card Payments Only
>
> Secure Fields only accepts card payments. Therefore, if your customer chooses a payment method other than a card, you need to use another Yuno integration.


> ðŸ“˜ Display Payment Methods
>
> You're responsible for displaying the payment methods and capturing the customer's selection when using the Secure Fields SDK.


### Step 4: Implement the SDK and get a One-Time Token

After the customer selects the payment method, you have to initialize the Secure Fields SDK to get a One-Time Token before creating the payment.

To initialize Yuno's Secure Fields SDK, you have to provide your API credentials and the  `checkout_session`. Follow these steps to complete the process:

1. Include the library in your project.
2. Initialize the SDK with the public key.
3. Start the checkout process by calling `yuno.secureFields()` with your configuration. 
4. Mount the Secure Fields SDK using the`secureFields.create()` function to display the checkout to your customers. 
5. Generate a One-Time Token using `secureFields.generateToken()` or `secureFields.generateTokenWithInformatio()` functions.

For more information on how to initiate Yuno's SDK, refer to the corresponding platform guide:

### Step 5: Create the payment

With the One-Time Token, create the payment. This process gathers all order details, including customer specifics, total amount, currency, products, and shipping details. Use the [Create Payment](ref:create-payment) endpoint, informing the `one_time_token`.

> ðŸ“˜ Payment status
>
> Use the payment `status` and `sub_status` as your primary reference for the payment's state during integration. Since a payment might have multiple associated transactions, concentrating on the payment `status/sub_status` ensures you're informed of the most recent state. This provides a clear basis for decision-making regardless of the number of transactions involved.
>
> To display the current payment status for your clients, you can use the [mountStatusPayment](docs/payment-status#step-3-use-status) function.


### Step 6: Receive payment result through webhook

Yuno also recommends configuring [Webhooks](doc:webhooks)  in your [dashboard](https://auth.y.uno/u/login?). Webhooks are the best way to ensure your system is up-to-date with payment progress and status. Since the event notifications trigger automatically, your system won't need to perform recurrent requests to Yuno.

## Enroll a credit card while paying

With Secure Fields SDK, you can save credit/debit cards for future purchases with the same payment request without the enrollment [integration](enrollment-lite).  You can obtain the[ vaulted token](doc:tokens) in two ways:

* Set `vault_on_sucess = true` when using the [Create Payment](ref:create-payment) endpoint. You will receive the `vaulted_token` that corresponds to the card used by the customer payer in the response.
* Set `saveCard = true` when creating the One-Time Token in [Step 4](#step-4-implement-the-sdk-and-get-a-one-time-token). The SDK will display a checkbox for users to select if they want to save the card for future purchases. If the user checks the box, you will receive the `vaulted_token`.

> ðŸ“˜ Card enrollment options
>
> You should only use one option to enroll a card. To enroll alternative payment methods, see the [Lite SDK (Enrollment)](enrollment-lite) page.


After enrolling in a payment method, you can use the vaulted token to perform payments. To access information about the payment methods enrolled by each user, you can use one of the following endpoints:

* [Get payment methods by checkout session](ref:retrieve-payment-methods-for-checkout).
* [Get payment methods by customer](ref:retrieve-enrolled-payment-methods-api).
