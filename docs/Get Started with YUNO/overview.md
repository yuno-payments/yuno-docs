Welcome to the Yuno getting started guide. This section is designed to provide developers and businesses with a step-by-step guide to creating their first payment and performing the basic setup required to integrate Yuno services into their platform.

With Yuno's services, managing multiple payment gateways is simplified, streamlining the payment process. Instead of integrating with several payment providers individually, you only need to integrate with Yuno once to access numerous payment methods and gateways. For more information, visit the [How Yuno works](doc:what-is-yuno) section.

To complete this guide, follow these steps:

1. [Set up your account](doc:step-1-set-up-your-account)
2. [Create your first payment](doc:step-2-your-first-payment)

Once you've completed these steps, you'll be ready to learn more about Yuno and start your integration.

As you explore this guide, you'll find comprehensive information to simplify your integration process. Regardless of your experience level with payment solutions, we're here to help. For any questions or if you encounter challenges, please reach out to your technical account manager.
