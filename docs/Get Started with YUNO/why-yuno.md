## The ultimate solution to make online checkout fast, easy and safe

Companies around the globe are struggling to keep up with payment integrations that enable them to offer their customers all payment methods currently available in the market. With fraud and the cost of processing payments increasing, integrating hundreds of payment methods within a platform has been a pain point for medium and large companies.

Yuno enables any company to accept all the available payment methods and manage fraud through a single integration. Our solution addresses the main problems associated with the suboptimal payment performance and customer experience that many platforms offer, such as low approval rates, long and broken processes, and poor fraud management.

## What are the benefits of using Yuno?

Yuno lets you connect to several payment methods and acquirers, customizing each operation in a simple and intuitive dashboard. With Yuno, you have access to the following benefits:

* One single integration that connects your company to all payment ecosystems and anti-fraud solutions.
* Embedded checkout with full customization from our dashboard and user-based payment method tokenization. 
* Workflows to control your payment stack with clicks and not with code. 
* Tools to group all your transactional data in a single source of truth.
* Commercial team to scale partnerships.

## Hundreds of payment services in one integration

It has never been this easy to build and manage your payments stack.  Yuno allows you to connect dozens or even hundreds of payment methods within a single integration. If there is any provider you would like to offer to your clients, just let us know. We are releasing new integrations on a monthly basis.
